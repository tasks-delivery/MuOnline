>Starting bonus system for new players that kicks in after a few weeks of server uptime

![](https://womu.by:8020/images/release132/bonus_start.png)

>Balanced PvP system, on early resets some classes will have an advantage, but closer to full stat each class will be on an equal footing.

>Own system of game quests with a pleasant reward in the form of stat points that do not burn out after a reset. The list of quests will grow in some updates, at the moment you have 200 quests available.

![](https://womu.by:8020/images/quest_system_box.png)

<summary>Kalima</summary>

## What is Kalima?
Kalima is the world of Lord Kundun. Only the one who collects the lost card, which consists of 5 parts, can enter it. There are 7 gates that players of certain levels can enter.

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSQ1TjfY7kPCN35xd8YPJNRGLywycxDL62cLPp_nUB8su7NXLiuoThC8AJsyCgeQUCBUC8&usqp=CAU)

## How to get to Kalima?
In order to go to the Kalima map, you need to have a ticket for the passage - Lost Map. To get it, you need to get parts of the ticket - Symbol of Kundun. After you collect 5 identical parts of the Symbol of Kundun, they will automatically turn into a Lost Map of the same level as the parts of the ticket.

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJ19WePyYE1vQYaXy3D-qJWoUEXA69yUx5bv379QBX9yyJBQfNDSTsgLvWOlC64yh5i6M&usqp=CAU)

To get to Kalima, you must throw the ticket out of your inventory and a gate will appear next to you. After clicking on the gate, you will appear in Kalima.

## On the servers of the WoMu project, the Kalima map has a special meaning, the % drop of zen in this map is increased and this map is the main one for gemstone farming.

The ticket cannot be dropped in the safe area
The gate after the ticket is thrown out only exists for a minute
You can enter Kalima in parties
If you get killed in Kalima, you will spawn in Lorencia
Each level of the Kalima map has certain level requirements for characters who want to get there.

## Illusion of Kundun

The illusion of Kundun was created by Kundun himself. After killing him, a gate appears that will teleport you to the next level of Kalima.

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSlY1tGam8hovqgUJPLwVm6Okmawd08bK27gu7rpxVSw38PHGu5Q2id-Fzfom4SDqhUjkc&usqp=CAU)

## Kundun

Kundun is the boss at the end of Kalima 7. He has a special skill that makes him unable to damage him for 20 seconds, while restoring his health, so killing him is sometimes very difficult. After killing him, you can drop from one to three Ancient items. The next time, just like Illusion of Kundun, the Kundun boss will appear after 24 hours from the moment of his death.

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTx8zWOtyE_UJ-wKd5Tww88_t4_j0lQak8LdyQ7RoEUtAOVDGUbeBa_1zzQPYqNPc_7cLk&usqp=CAU)

The list of rewards for each Kalima boss and their spawns can be viewed below:

|Boss|Reward|Location|Respawn time
|--|--|--|--|
|Illusion of Kundun | Box of kundun +1 | Kalima 1 | 3 hours
|Illusion of Kundun | Box of kundun +2 | Kalima 2 | 6 hours

<summary>Offexp и Offattack</summary>

## What is Offexp & offattack?
The offline leveling system was introduced in order to save you from problems with installing a character on AFK (such inconveniences as: using clickers, leaving the computer turned on at night or leaving home, disconnected connections, using the computer for other purposes / games). Your character remains in the game even when the game client is closed.

## Usage:

>You can set a character to offline pumping only not in a safe zone (outside the city).

>To install, you need to write the /attack command in the chat, and then the /offattack command. After you should see the reconnect process and you can safely close the game.

>After killing a character who is offline, he will remain merged in the game.

>If your weapon breaks, then the attack will go on, but without adding damage.

>The character can be in the Party during offline leveling.

## Special magic:

For offline pumping, certain magics are required, each race has its own (see below), if you have not studied this skill, then the hero will not attack.

You cannot change magic manually, the system will automatically select magic for you in the order described in the table below.
For example, Dark Wizard - Ice Storm, Evil Spirit, Inferno. This means that if you have Ice Storm, then you will hit it, if not, the system will check if you have Evil spirit, if not, it will hit Inferno.

|Race |Working skills for offline leveling
|--|--|
|Dark Knight| Twisting Slash, Death Stab
|Dark Wizard| Ice Storm, Evil Spirit, Inferno
|Fairy Elf |Five Shot
|Summoners| Red Storm, Chain Lightning
|Magic Gladiator | Sword Slash, Lightning Storm, Power Slash Evil Spirit
|Dark Lord| Fire Burst, Fire Scream

In offattack mode, the character will not collect drops, but you can level up while you are busy with your fox business.

Old Scroll +[1-6] + Illusion Sorcerer Covenant +[1-6] + 1x Jewel of Chaos = Scroll of Blood +[1-6]

![alt text](https://muonlinefanz.com/guide/minigame/it/data/graphics/1234.jpg)

Depending on your level, you will need different amounts of ZEN.

You have about 5 minutes to enter the temple. With min. number of players the event will start.

In the waiting room, you will be randomly divided into 2 teams: Red Team and Blue Team. This process will only take a minute, then the fight will start immediately.

Your task is to bring the ball to the podium of your team. The team that returns the ball 7 times wins. It sounds simple, but in fact there are some difficulties.

>You must be at the statue for at least 10 seconds to pick up the ball.

>Remember, when you dribble, you are displayed on the map and your running speed will decrease, making you more vulnerable to being caught by the other team.

>Once you bounce the ball back to your podium (you have to be there for 10 seconds), your team gets a point. Then the statue will reappear in a random place.

>If you die, your ball can be picked up by any other player.

<summary>[Event] CryWolf</summary>

## What is Crywolf?
Crywolf is a fortress located southeast of the Valley of Loren. Here the battles of the alliance of humans and elves with the large army of Kundun take place. The fortress is ideally located on hilly terrain for its defense, so it is a key strategic area.
Kundun ordered his army under the command of Balgass to capture the fortress, so that he would have the opportunity to break into the server.
Any character can take part.
You can get on the Crywolf card:
>From the Valey of Loren map at coordinates 161 41;

>Through the teleportation menu by pressing the 'M' key;

![alt text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQjMKwQ_4aJA4IlAwRYWPeXO7o7O8eymhs5Usn6HURzbuDXgClqjRd5wCp-gZkmI-xuy_c&usqp=CAU)

## Information about the battle for Crywolf
>Balgass and his army start attacking every Wednesday at 21:00;

>All players will be notified about the beginning of the battle by a message in the GM chat (a flashing message in gold in the center of the screen);

>Duration of the battle - 30 minutes;

>At the beginning of the battle, the peaceful zone in the fortress becomes combat;

>Characters will be prohibited from using the Personal Store and NPCs for the duration of the battle.

>If a hero dies during a battle, he will be resurrected in a peaceful area of ​​the Crywolf map;

>The goal of the battle is to protect the statue of the Holy Wolf from destruction and kill Balgass

## Sacred Wolf Statue

This statue is a creation of the ancient elves and is huge in size and has incredible power, which allows you to hold back the army of Kundun'a.
She is also the target of Balgass and his army - the destruction of the statue will allow him to take over the fortress of Crywolf. Therefore, players must protect her with all their might and prevent Balgass from reaching his goal.

![alt text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSLbuAG70YPpEMQSpyPBf-6UplCMgG9xOX509zk28XOpqccyGo0nBlHhbRj6ZpQiLlJsxo&usqp=CAU)

## Altars
Around the statue of the Holy Wolf are 5 altars, which are designed to increase the strength of the statue at the expense of the energy of the elves.

![alt text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ7hpSRzO_4LDfAmiS5dU9SQBOW7uqp4edS4rn8jq5huMeLpDAv2tSFVKW6Ypx6GHHA2rA&usqp=CAU)

For Balgass, the altars are the initial target, because once they are destroyed, the statue loses its defensive abilities. To be successful in battle, the players and, not least, the elves must put a lot of effort into protecting the statue. If at the beginning of the battle no altar is attached to the elf, then the battle is automatically considered lost.

## Role of elves in battle

>The elves in this battle have one of the most important roles - to increase the protection of the statue at the expense of their energy. To do this, up to five Muse Elf / HighElf characters can join each of the altars.
When the elf is successfully attached to the altar, the character will not be able to perform any actions. Any movement, attack, or death of the character will break the connection to the altar.
No more than two attempts to stand on each altar are allowed. To do this, the players have two minutes before the start of the battle.
The life force of the statue is increased by the health of each of the attached elves. That is, the more elves stood on the altars, the more health the statue has. If the health of the elf that is on the altar decreases during the battle, the health of the statue also decreases.

## Battle progress

>Before Balgass starts attacking the statue, his army tries to weaken the defense by attacking the characters that are in the fight. To do this, he sent histroops led by twelve Dark Elves.
The task of the players during the first battle is to kill all the Dark Elves in order for Balgass to launch the attack himself.

![alt text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR31QY2GAcXUd4xxXgSXR5Xer-5V1lSfWqlfw&usqp=CAU)


After Balgass's entire army is destroyed, there is nothing left for him to do. how to attack a fortress alone. Therefore, in the last 5 minutes before the end of the battle, Balgass comes to the statue and tries to complete his evil intent.
Balgass has a lot of dangerous spells in his arsenal that can cause a lot of problems for the defenders of the fortress. One of these is the mass freezing of players (Stern).
Balgass' health will be displayed in the upper left corner below the statue's health. When the health level reaches zero, Balgass is considered defeated, and the defense of the fortress is successful. If Balgass is not defeated within the last five minutes, then the battle is considered lost.
